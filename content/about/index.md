I’m João Medeiros, a Senior Software Engineer with over a decade of experience in Software Development. I’m a Django specialist and a Formula 1 fan. Currently I work at [Buser Brasil](https://linkedin.com/company/buserbrasil/) as a Fullstack Senior Engineer.

I have experience making decisions concerning both backend and frontend infrastructure. I have also been active in cloud software development for most of my career.

Versatility and curiosity are my key strengths. I love picking up new languages, frameworks, and libraries.

Technologies that I love and use daily or used extensively:

- Python
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud and AWS
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Linux
- Distributed systems (Celery, Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Redis
