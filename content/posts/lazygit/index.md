## Introduction
I've always been very enthusiastic about doing everything on the terminal unless something can't be done (rare) or it's very difficult to accomplish using a terminal, I would never start a GUI for that. One good example of that is managing git repos locally.

I tried many times using the integrated git client for both Jetbrains IDEs and VS Code and I can't get used to it, managing repositories is not that difficult and I feel that using a GUI client for it is overkill.

Months ago I discovered [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) and it was mind-blowing, the tool helps me manage git repos and I don't even need to leave the terminal for that, a win-win solution. Today we will explore a bit Lazygit.

## Lazygit
I use [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) primarily to stage and stash files, commit my changes, rebase, push, and update branches from/to upstream, pretty simple but I feel that is faster to do it through Lazygit, if you try it you’ll probably feel the same as me. [On their repository](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#features), you can find more details of all the features Lazygit has.

### The best features
Below I'll add the best features that Lazygit has in my opinion and the ones I use the most:

- [Stage individual lines](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#stage-individual-lines)
- [Interactive rebase](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#interactive-rebase)
- [Amend old commits](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#amend-an-old-commit)
- [Invoking custom commands](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#invoke-a-custom-command)
- [Undo mistakes](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#undo)

## Other "Lazy" products
Besides Lazygit, you can find other projects from the same author that work similarly to it:

- [Lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker): A terminal UI to manage Docker and compose
- [Lazymigrate](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazy_migrate): To help you managing Rails migrations
- [Lazycli](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazycli): To turn other CLI commands into a lazy cli

## Conclusion
If you're like me and hate leaving terminal for basic stuff, you should try lazygit. Let me know your thoughts about it in the comments.
